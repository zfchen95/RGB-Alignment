# RGB-Alignment
Colorizing Prokudin-Gorskii images
This is a course project for CS 543 Computer Vision. It divides the image into three equal parts (channels) and align two of the channels to the third.
Some example output:
<p align="center">
  <img src="00125v.jpg" width="350"/>
  <img src="00125v.jpg" width="350"/>
</p>
